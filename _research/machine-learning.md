Astronomy is rapidly becoming a big data science, and therefore much of my recent work involves machine learning and astrostatistics.  These methods have provided insights not just into galaxy evolution, but a wide range of astronomical problems.  I have particularly focused on methods for classifying objects, so that additional observations of a small, well-chosen sample allows us to learn about the entire dataset.  A main advantage of these methods is that the classification does not come from theoretical models, but rather from the data itself.  

Successful applications of these other astrostatistical methods include:

* A method for identifying objects where template fitting has produced a "catastrophically"-wrong redshift, then correcting these to produce more complete catalogs of the early Universe.
* An improved selection of "dead", or quiescent, galaxies
* Classifying gamma-ray bursts into two types from their prompt emission alone, a central problem in the study of these bursts
* A re-analysis of Type Ia supernova data suggesting the possibility of a new disagreement between local and early-Universe measurements of the composition of the Universe in addition to the previously-reported tension between measurements of the Hubble constant.
