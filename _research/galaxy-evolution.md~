## Fundamental Puzzles in Galaxy Evolution

The history of a typical galaxy has three stages: 

* Assembly of the ingredients that will eventually turn into a galaxy
* Production of stars, a central supermassive black hole, and recognizable structure
* Galaxy "death", with all of these growth processes stopping.

Over the past 10-15 years, we have found fundamental puzzles with the potential to significantly change our understanding of each of these stages.  Observations of the first, most massive galaxies reveal

# How can we solve these puzzles?
